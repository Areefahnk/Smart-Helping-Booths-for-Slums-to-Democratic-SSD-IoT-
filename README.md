# Smart-Helping-Booths-for-Slums-to-Democratic-SSD-IoT-

India is the biggest democratic country in the world which has taken giant strides in the last few decades and we are now the world’s sixth-largest economy. But in between this, we cannot forget everyday issues that still continue to pose hurdles in the progress of the nation. Though our country holds the title as democratic, there’s still a communication gap between the people and the government. This is the gap that is under covering and ignoring the sufferings of the people living in harsh conditions in the slums. Technologies are meant not only to learn but to implement and utilize it at the most. With the same aim, we have built a smart helping booth named as S2D (Slums to Democratic) that could be implemented in the slums and serve its need in this era of nation’s development. Now let us consider a major problem – food scarcity. For this we have built the booth which consists of fingerprint sensor. When comes to the real time implementation, it would work with big data analysis of the aadhaar card basis. For demonstration, we have enrolled few finger ID’s through the arduino software. Whenever there is a need of food by the slum resident, he/she need to approach the booth and scan his/her fingerprint. Once the fingerprint is detected, the ID would traverse through the thingspeak channel which would be present at the nearby NGO. The alarm would ring so as caution the NGO person. Thus, once the NGO person identifies the fingerprint ID in the channel, the immediate action would take place.

*SOFTWARE: ARDUINO IDE

*CLAIM SET:

1.	Fingerprint sensor

2.	ESP8266 (Wi-Fi modem)

3.	Channel for data transfer

4.	Virtuino for alarm when data transferred
